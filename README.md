# DS-project-customer-churn

## Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their service, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Techniques involved in project
1) Predictive modelling: - Data collection and loading
                         - Exploratory Data Analysis
                         - Data preprocessing and cleaning (for example, check for missing values)
                         - Feature engineering and selection (Feature scaling and encoding categorical variables)
                         - Data splitting (features and label)
                         - Models Training (models such as random forest, svm, xgboost)
                         - cross validation and hyperparameter tuning
                         - prediction made using models
                         - Models evaluation (accuracy of models)


## Objectives
- Predict behaviour to retain customers
- build predictive models to identify potential churners
- Compare performance of different machine learning algorithms


### Tools needed
